Read Me:

To run code you will need numpy and pandas libraries. ipython is a plus too for interactivity with the data. See http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/ for download of all key libraries needed (except ipython notebook).

My perspective was to create something that an analyst could manipulate in a python (R) like environment. Thus output is done via ipython console vs. printing to the screen. I could have gone deeper on OO front but wanted to deliver Pandas (R like) Dataframe for the analyst. 

No error handling.

Minimal unittest dev- although lots of interactive testing in ipython.

My data files all had first two lines concatenated so I put in quick parsing logic for this error.
